title: Thinking, Fast and Slow
description: |
  Ever wondered why there are some instances where you feel like, after the fact, you weren't in control of your decisions? Or why you have sudden breakthroughs after thinking hard about a problem for hours, days, or weeks? Daniel Kahneman paints a vivid picture of the human brain, and how we have a few different "modes" of thought, and how our "rational", methodical thinking isn't really in the drivers seat, and why that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
