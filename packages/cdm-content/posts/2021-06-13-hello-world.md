# Welcome to the zen garden

This site has been in use for a long time, with a lot of "half-baked" ideas over the years (*Perhaps I'll come back to this post later and give some examples...*). Considering, I decided enough was enough, and took the same incremental approach I've learned to take when the **$$$** are on the line.

That means **build what you need, like you're gonna share it, and only as far as you need it _today_**.

## The result

You're looking at it, and enjoy it, because it might change tomorrow. That's the point.

I've taken this opportunity to experiment with:

- A `Box` component \*, which makes vertical and horizontal rhythm in your layouts easy.
- A `Stack` component\*, which makes arranging groups of items with obvious spacing dead-simple.
- A smart `Layout` component\*, which makes arranging auto-adapting layouts based on fixed grid sizes, infintely nestable with auto-generating CSS rules.
- A performant Javascript `breakpoint` solution\*
- A `LongFormText` component\*, which maps markdown, HTML, portabletext, or custom transformers that you write yourself, to your own React components. Take long form content, and make it gorgeous.
- A namespace-first architecture, using package architecture, to create a self-documenting Javascript/Typescript system.
- A Git-based content repository, _which might be editable in-browser, using Git, sometime soon..._
- And a bunch of other cool stuff that I'll probably write about

## What's next?

Well, I need to live up to the front page, so...

- I'll write about my posh coffee
- I'll fill out my [bookshelf](/bookshelf)
- And explain my philosophy of thinking hard to not think hard
