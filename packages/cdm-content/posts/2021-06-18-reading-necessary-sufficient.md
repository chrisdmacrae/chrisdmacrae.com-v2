title: Reading Is Necessary; Reading Is Not Enough
description: |
  Reading is necessary to success. It has been since 3200 BCE. But reading is not sufficient to create success.

In 2017, I took on the personal challenge of **reading 52 books in the year**, at a minimum of 200 pages, making for 10,400 pages to cover in 8700 hours (one year). That left me with a little under 45 minutes per page, which _sounded_ reasonable (it wasn't). 

In fact, with all of the other _living_ one has to do, you really only end up with a few hours per day, leaving you closer to 1000-1500 hours.

So I buckled down, read non-stop, and **I learned almost nothing**.

# Necessary, But Not Sufficient

Reading is necessary to long-term, general success. Sometimes we get lucky, we have inside knowlegde, or we're in the right place at the right times, or have some kind of unfair advantage against the competition that leads us to _temporary_ success. But this success can't last forever, meaning you're fighting a losing battle.

However, it isn't sufficient for success. Reading is only the first step to the process of learning, and without an understanding of it, you will waste a great deal of you effort on activites that _don't make you wiser_.

- model
  - receive knowledge (facts)
  - summarize patterns, trends, and anonomalies and build a mental model of the relationships
  - intervene in the world, and wait and see wait happens, then repeat
