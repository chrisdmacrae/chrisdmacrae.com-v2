title: Reading Is Necessary; Reading Is Not Enough 
description: | 
  Almost everyone has a book, teacher, or story that was pivotal to the major
  success of their life. This begs the question, why?
---
In 2017, I took on the personal challenge of **reading fifty-two books  with at least of 200 pages  in the
year**, making for 10,400 pages to cover in 8700
hours (one year). That left me with a little under 45 minutes per page,
which _sounded_ reasonable (spoiler: it wasn't).

In fact, with all the other _living_ one must do, you only end
up with a few hours per day, leaving you closer to 700-1200 hours. (`2-3
hours per day * 7 days per week * 52 weeks per year`.)

This left me with around 6 minutes per page in the best case. So, I buckled
down, read non-stop, and **I learned almost nothing**.

# Necessary, But Not Sufficient

Reading is necessary to long-term, general success. Sometimes we get lucky,
we have inside knowledge, or we're in the right place at the right times,
or have an unfair advantage against the competition that leads us
to _temporary_ success. But this success can't last forever, meaning you're
fighting a losing battle. You need to learn general strategies that will
let you survive a variety of situations you haven't already experienced. By
definition, you can't know what you haven't experienced, so you need to
learn it from _others_.

While reading is necessary, it isn't sufficient for success. Look at my
story, I read fifty-two books and I didn't learn or correctly remember a
damned thing. The knowledge passed through my brain like the wind through
the trees because I didn't _encode_ the information in my brain.

Reading is only the first step to the process of learning, and without an
understanding of it, you will waste a great deal of your effort on activities
that _don't make you wiser [^1]_.

# Mental Models, Success Quantified

What _is_ sufficient? For our purposes, sufficient is any strategy that
either:

- Doesn't prevent you from trying another; i.e. it doesn't ruin your life
  or kill you, or;
- Is close to guaranteed to get you the result you want; i.e. its 80%-100%
  likely to get a positive outcome

To try and find these strategies, we can talk about [how humans
learn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38923582-how-humans-learn), the
statistics of successful people, and a lot of other topics. The former
_could be_ useful because it gives us the first principles [^2] necessary
to start from nothing with a new idea for success.

The rest only give us a shallow truth. Either what was _necessary on
average_, but not sufficient for success, or what lead a single
individual/small group of individuals to success in their specific
circumstance. These things are all _necessary_ for success, but they are
not a promise or a strategy to get there.

What is sufficient for success is **mental models -- or systems of thought
-- that help us achieve what is necessary and protect ourselves from undue
risk**. Mental models allow us to take shortcuts in our thinking when we
need to react quickly, or when we're dealing with a complex situation where
we don't have the whole picture _(i.e. real life)_. They're our **maps for
life**.

In fact, mental models are what experts believe differentiate us from a lot
of other life on earth. The process of purposefully designing mental models
seems unique to us, for now. For our purpose, we'll call this process the
causal ladder, or the steps to wisdom.

## The Causal Ladder

![Causal Ladder](/uploads/causal-ladder.png)

Our ability to interact with the world to gain knowledge and remember what
caused it is not unique -- most developed forms of life can do this -- and
it's sometimes called **association, the bottom rung of the ladder**. It's
the act of observing the world around us, what happens, where it happens,
when it happens and making associations about what effects what. This helps
us, and most other life, understand that what usually happens, in what
order, and whether it's good for us or not. It's another human eating
something and getting sick and warning you about eating it. This is no
different from reading someone else's book, or the act of listening to the story of someone
else's experiences to help you draw a better map of the world.

The **second rung of the ladder, intervention**, is unique to the most
developed forms of life, including us, the great apes, man's best friend
the dog, and other mammals. It's the cognitive ability to ask **"what if I
do..." questions, and then do it to the world to try them out**. This
ability lets us use our own experience as a tool for learning what works,
what doesn't, and whether we should keep doing it. This is the act of
building mental models through continuous feedback. Every time we intervene
in the world, watch what happens, and make associations, we have the
_potential_ of becoming wiser.

The **last rung of the ladder, counterfactuals or imagination**, is the
ability that seems to be unique to humans. It's the ability to imagine what
_could_ have happened. It's the ability to **use a mental model to replay
events with different variables to get a rough idea of alternative
outcomes**. It's a young hunter gatherer imagining if the hunt will fail if
he only takes 3 men instead of 6, and tweak that number in his mental model
until it seems plausible.

This ability to replay history or potential futures in our heads with
different events and imagine different outcomes is our secret to success.
With strong mental models of the world, we can replay them out with
different variables and events to try and select the most desirable path.

So, with a basic understanding of the our ability to...

1. Learn through our senses to build rough mental models
2. Intervene in the world, get continuous feedback, and improve our
   mental models
3. Replay our mental models with different variables and events to get an 
idea of different results

...we can try to succeed in life without taking risks that will ruin us, or
worse, kill us.
## Taking Reading All The Way

With a basic understanding of the causal ladder, let's loop back to our
topic de jour, reading. Reading is not sufficient, because reading is only
the _first rung_, and because our brains are notoriously good at ignoring
information (we almost always lose information immediately after sensing
it, otherwise we'd go nuts with sensory overload)[^3].

So what do we do about this? Well, it's simple: go up the ladder.

If we read or listen to a chapter of a book, listen to an expert's opinions
from study, or experience something first-hand and find that the knowledge
to seem useful, we must move up the ladder of causation to rung two,
intervention. We need to _do_ something with it as soon as possible (before
bed!), and the most important thing to do is _externalize it_ outside of
memory. Write it down, record it in a notebook,
[zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), or other format,
teach it to someone. The better the externalization is for recall, how
accurate it is when you come back to it, the better your learning will be.
Now you can _stop_ thinking about it _for now_, and not need to devote
energy and focus to committing it to memory, leaving your brain ready to
improve your mental models.

Then, when you return to it at a later date, either during periods of
reflection or at a moments notice when it comes to mind as being useful,
you can start over at rung one, and start making associations to try and
construct a useful mental model for the situation. This association will
allow you to move up into rung two once more, and take the final step to
rung three, counterfactuals. With the ability to perfectly recall
externalized knowledge, make associations and construct a valid mental
model of the circumstances, you can adjust your mental model
and _imagine the result_ without having to act it out. This way,
you can get an idea of what approach is most likely to have a good
result.

Without the act of experiencing or observing, then the act of intervening,
and our ability to imagine scenarios where we intervene, we do not learn,
we do not improve our mental models, and we do not succeed and thrive. So, if you aren't the type to _do_, it's time to lift your leg off the first rung and
move it up to the second.
