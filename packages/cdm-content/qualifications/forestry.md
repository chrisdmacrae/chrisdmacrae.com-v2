At Forestry, I served as a consultant, doing market research, user research and business analysis. As the head of developer relations, helping the software teams better understand their customers problems, and as the Head of Customer Solutions where I delivered solutions to fortune 500 companies with 100s of daily active users.

In this time, my work was at times responsible for 30-50% of the companies revenue, and I had the pleasure of leading my teams to net positive increases in velocity, daily active users, and increased annual revenue.

I also helped the team adopt agile practices and mental models, starting by implementing the scrum framework in 2018.
