At SimplyCast, I worked as a junior product designer, assisting the principle product designer modernize the application.

I also had the opportunity to work with, and then manage the marketing department for the company, helping deliver front-to-back marketing solutions, including web design, development, SEO, digital PPC and marketing campaigns.

During this time, I helped deliver an entire re-brand of the company, covering web, mobile, social media, and our physical space.

I had the pleasure of working with EastLink, the Province of Nova Scotia, and a variety of universities and colleges.
