At MindSea, I served as the principle UX designer on a variety of projects, and assisted in running 2-4 week design sprints to help our customers validate their business ideas and figure out critical paths to get to market.

I helped the leadership team at MindSea develop the [MindSea Blueprint](https://content.mindsea.com/blueprint), a productized service offering to help businesses validate their software ideas in less than four weeks, delivering a buildable statement of work, critical path wireframes for all features, and a visual design and brain guideline for the development team.

I had the pleasure of working with the East Coast Music Awards, PostMedia, the Dallas Morning News, Trans Canada Trail, and a variety of other fantastic organizations.
