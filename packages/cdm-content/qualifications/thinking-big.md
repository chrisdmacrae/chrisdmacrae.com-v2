At Thinking Big, I served as a principle UX designer and fullstack developer with Veterans Affairs Canada, helping the department modernize their benefit processes with end-to-end digital application processes, using guided digital web forms, Dynamics 365 CRM, and a variety of custom .NET tools.

While at Veterans Affairs, my team exceeded our annual goal for UX and software delivery by 10x (900%), by delivery 10x more outcomes than forecasted, saving Candian Veterans an upwards of 30 _hours_ per month in some cases, and getting them access to critical benefits 3-5 months faster than previous.

I also had the priviledge of working with Maritime Electric, Great Hobbies, Treasury Board of Canada, and the Canadian Revenue Agency on a casual basis.
