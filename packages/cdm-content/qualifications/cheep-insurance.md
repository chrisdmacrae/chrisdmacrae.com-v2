Cheep Insurance hired my consulting team in 2016 to help them maintain their tech stack, including a Wordpress marketing site, self-serve customer portal, and various product information and marketing tools.

We helped the Cheep team operationalize their marketing collateral with a self-serve component page builder, social media and SEO toolkit, and user studies, all of which is still in use as of 2021.

We helped the Cheep Insurance team get on the front page of Google, maintain steady growth, and manage their website over 5 years without on-going assistance from a web designer or frontend developer.
