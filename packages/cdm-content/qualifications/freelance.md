Since 2016, I have consulted with various businesses, helping companies:

- Deliver stellar digital product and customer experiences
- Build and maintain full stack technical solutions, using monolithic, serverless, and JAMStack architectures
- Manage network and cloud infrastructure
- Create SMB marketing and brand strategies

Some of my best full-time experiences have started through consulting, which has given me a broad understanding of business and many industries, and has allowed me to employ 12 people at different times in a six year period.

I've had the pleasure of working with PostMedia, The Dallas Morning News, EastLink, the East Coast Music Awards as a designer and marketing specialist, and Apple, Spotify, Telus and other fantastic organizations as a technical project manager.
