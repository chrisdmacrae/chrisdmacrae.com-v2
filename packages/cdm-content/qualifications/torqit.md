At Torq IT, I help manage our customer relationships, business development strategies/experiments, and get down in the trenches with my team to help deliver full stack solutions to our customers.

Since joining, I've helped the team better understand their core business, helped the business development, sales, and marketing come in-house, greatly lowering operating expenses and inventory while increasing our throughput on business outcomes.
