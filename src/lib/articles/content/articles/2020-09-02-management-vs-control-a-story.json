      "content": "We live in a world where management is ubiquitous. The Industrial Age brought upon the corporation, and the corporation the manager. But somewhere along the way, we forgot what the management was truly about.\n\n## The Control Conundrum\n\nWhat _is **control**_? According to the definition from Oxford dictionary, it is:\n\n> The power to influence or direct people's behavior or the course of events\n\nas well as,\n\n> to determine the behaviour or supervise the running of.\n\nSo control is to deciding how people behave, or how life will unfold, and supervising them to ensure that happens?\n\nControl is deterministic, you assert your will, and get the behaviour you want out. But this is not true for human beings, or even when we try to make progress in life.\n\nHow many times have you tried to have a well-planned conversation with someone, or tried to finish a project, to have everything go wrong and not end up anything like you expected? I don't know about you, but I do not believe I can snap my fingers and make people behave the way I want, or have life go the way I want. Anyone who thinks like this is surely setting themselves up for sadness and failure.\n\nBut, lets take a moment, and look at the definition of _**management**_ from the top result, Oxford Dictionary, on Google on September 1, 2020:\n\n> the process of dealing with or controlling things or people.\n\nHow can management be the control of people or things? Isn't this an oxymoron? Isn't this what we revolted against through democracy, the kings who dictated our every action and move?\n\nThat's the _control conundrum_. We live in a world that has forgotten what management is, and instead seeks to control through <dfn title=\"The practice of analyzing and describing a complex phenomenon in terms of phenomena that are held to represent a simpler or more fundamental level, especially when this is said to provide a sufficient explanation.\">reductionism</dfn> and <dfn title=\"Scientific rigor means implementing the highest standards and best practices of the scientific method and applying those to one's research. It is all about discovering the truth. Scientific rigor involves minimizing bias in subject selection and data analysis.\">scientific rigour</dfn>. I mean, if we understand and control the parts, we control the sum, right?\n\n## What is Management?\n\nSo then, what _is, or was,_ management? To understand this, we must move back in time, to the start of the twentieth century, the dawn of the Industrial Age.\n\nWe find a man named Fredrick W. Taylor, and his _Theory of Management_, commonly called _Taylorism._ So what was Taylorism?\n\nIt was a scientific theory, which he developed by applying scientific rigour to examine _factories_ and _production lines_ to learn how to optimize them, and make them more efficient. It proposed that _\"by optimizing and simplifying \\[manufacturing\\] jobs, productivity would increase,\"_ and _\"all workers were motivated by money, so a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.\"_\n\nTaylorism was revolutionary in an era of industrialization where the factory manager spent very little time with the floor workers, and floor workers only motivation to work as hard as a machine was to get paid.\n\nIts proposal said that by optimizing human resources as machines by simplifying their work made it more effective, because individuals became easier to train, replace, and make efficient. It optimized for the _industrial machine,_ a system, and not for the creative thought, perspective and ingenuity of each employee.\n\nThis was not about control. The goal was to optimize the outputs that could be generated from a specific set of inputs, by simplifying the system's behaviours.\n\nHowever, human beings are not machines, and as innovative new technology has been invented, the necessity of the human-as-machine has decreased dramatically. This required a great change in management.\n\n### The Failure of Management Thinking\n\nNow that we know the roots of management, the act of optimizing the system of a factory so that all of its mechanical parts (human beings included) were simple, cheap to fix or replace, and very efficient at doing one job, we can explore the change that occurred due to a massive migration to white collar work and digitization.\n\nAs the average worker moved from the factory floor and simple physical labour to the cubicle and <dfn title=\"Knowledge workers are workers whose main capital is knowledge. Examples include programmers, physicians, pharmacists, architects, engineers, scientists, design thinkers, public accountants, lawyers, and academics, and any other white-collar workers, whose line of work requires one to 'think for a living'\">knowledge work</dfn>, a change began to occur. Costs went up, output went down, and efficiencies dropped. People doing thought work could not be managed nearly as well as the unskilled factory worker. Moreover, the skill gap between worker and manager closed, creating the utility of adding _more_ managers to more closely monitor behaviour and input to guarantee desired output.\n\nHowever, as skilled workers began to move up into management position, management itself began to change. As individuals skilled at controlling tools moved into positions of management and began doing the work less, and coordinating the work more, they sought to apply their own order onto their direct reports, to control the new tools at their disposal: people.\n\nTherein lies the the failure of management. Management has forgotten what is it is there to do. It is not there to control what people do in their field, or how they solve the problems presented to them. It is:\n\n> **Managing the inputs of the system, in order to increase the probability of a desired outcome, while accepting the intrinsic behaviours of the system and incentivizing the desired behaviour.**\n\nIt is not:\n\n> **Controlling the behaviour of the parts of a system, to attempt to guarantee an output you know you can achieve.**\n\n## How Can One Manage, Then?\n\nManagement is not complicated, but it does have great complexity.\n\nThat is, complexity is used to refer to the level of components in a system. If a problem is complex, it means that it has many components. Complexity does not evoke difficulty. On the other hand, complicated refers to a high level of difficulty.\n\nThis complexity can lead to complications if we do not seek to first understand it, as we cannot manage the inputs, behaviours, and outputs of a group of people without first understanding what they are.\n\nIn knowledge work, this can be broken down into a hierarchy of things you must seek to understand:\n\n1. _<dfn title=\"one's intention or objective.\">Purpose</dfn>:_ why does the system exist? What effect does this system have that is greater than the sum of its parts?\n2. _<dfn title=\"the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something\">Values</dfn>:_  And are these values in accordance with the purpose?\n3. _<dfn title=\"a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behaviour or for a chain of reasoning.\">Principles</dfn>:_ what are the fundamental beliefs or truths of the system that dictate its behaviour, and are they in accordance with the values?\n4. _<dfn title=\"the actual application or use of an idea, belief, or method, as opposed to theories relating to it.\">Practices</dfn>:_ what are the actual behaviours or activities of the system that occur, and are they in accordance with the principles?\n\n_Protip_: do not trust what you _hear_, trust what you _see_ or _observe_. The rhetoric of a system is not always in accordance with its purpose, values, principles, or practices.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nManagement is not about control. It's about the careful, intentional observation of the system you work in, and the act of managing the inputs of the actors of the system to ensure those actors have all of the information to make good decisions. It's incentivizing those actors to behave in desirable ways.\n\nDo not seek to control, be comfortable with ambiguity, accept different opinions and perspectives, and trust the experts you work with to act in accordance with the values you set out for them.\n\n_**Sources**_\n\n* [https://www.skymark.com/resources/leaders/taylor.asp](https://www.skymark.com/resources/leaders/taylor.asp)\n* [https://www.business.com/articles/management-theory-of-frederick-taylor/](https://www.business.com/articles/management-theory-of-frederick-taylor/ \"https://www.business.com/articles/management-theory-of-frederick-taylor/\")\n* [https://hbr.org/2014/07/managements-three-eras-a-brief-history](https://hbr.org/2014/07/managements-three-eras-a-brief-history \"https://hbr.org/2014/07/managements-three-eras-a-brief-history\")"
