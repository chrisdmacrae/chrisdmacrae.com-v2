This website will serve as the home for my thoughts, and an open forum for discussion about them.\n\nI look forward to sharing a little bit about:\n\n* My thoughts on systems thinking, design, software development. üë®‚Äçüíª\n* My thoughts on the JAMStack, Static Web Applications, and serverless. ü§ì\n* My personal thinking of philosophy, and what makes the world tick. ü§î\n\nI'll also be covering just how this site works, including:\n\n* Setting up Next.js with a [Medium.com](https://medium.com)-like theme.\n* Setting up Next.js with TinaCMS, an open source editing toolkit.\n* Deploying Next.js to Vercel, to get [isomorphic rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript).\n* Setting up Web Mentions to get access to social networking features.\n\nStay tuned, as this nerd is looking forward to sharing his thoughts with you.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nChris Macrae"
